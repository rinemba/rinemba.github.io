<h2>Thursday — Big River <em>Relaxed</em></h2>

<p>This is a fun no-drop ride, not a race. The ride is held whenever conditions allow.</p>

<p>Contact me for more information or directions.</p>

<p>Normally we divide up into groups depending on how many people show up and how far or fast people want to ride.</p>

<p>Expect to see a lot of people at the start. This is one of Rhode Island's most popular rides. :-)</p>
