## Thursday — Big River *Relaxed*

This is a fun no-drop ride, not a race. The ride is held whenever conditions allow.

Contact me for more information or directions.

Normally we divide up into groups depending on how many people show up and how far or fast people want to ride.

Expect to see a lot of people at the start. This is one of Rhode Island's most popular rides. :-)
