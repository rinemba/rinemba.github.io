#North / South Trail
Are you looking for an epic mtb ride to do with friends?

well, the North/South Trail in RI may be the perfect answer!

The NST runs the entire length of the state from the Massachusetts border to the Atlantic Ocean. This awesome and scenic trail passes through and by eight Department of Environmental Management areas, historic villages, small family farms, tiny walled cemeteries and cool country churches. Overall, the entire ride consists of a great mix of every type of terrain ranging from technical single-track to paved road sections and everything in-between. The NST can be tackled in one day (8-12 hours depending on how motivated you are) but you may consider breaking the trip into a two day ride. The ride can be done in either direction, but you may wish to consider the fact that the northern part of the trip towards the Massachusetts border is more technical and requires quite a bit of ???hike a bike???.

Length: approximately 75 miles.

Grade: Varied from flat on-road sections to steep and rocky paths.

Trail condition: Good – well marked in most places. Look for these marks:

Natural attractions nearby: You name it – wildlife observation, hunting, fishing, paddle sports, etc.

Historical attractions nearby: Historical homes, Native American sites, including former taverns, old rail crossings, historical cemeteries.

Services nearby: None on trail, Bring plenty of water and food???something in addition to sports gels as your body might crave something more. PB&J is ideal.

Other Tips: Bring tubes, tools, spare quick chain link and possibly an extra folded tire in the event of a mechanical.
