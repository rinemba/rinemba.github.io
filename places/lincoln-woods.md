# Lincoln Woods

Lincoln Woods State Park is a 627 acre refuge located 5 miles north of Providence, RI off of route 146. This State Park closest to RI’s capital is a refuge for city dwelling mountain bikers, hikers, climbers, geocachers, equestrians, anglers and kayakers. There is a public beach on the property, as well as ball fields, stables and 92 picnic areas available by permit. The park is open all year, and is closed at sunset daily (yep, that means no night riding!). As always please use common sense during mud season. The trails drain exceptionally well, but there is still a small window every spring when the trails should be left alone. If you are in doubt please ride the road, or scout it out first.

While 627 acres may not inspire visions of an “epic” ride you can rest assured the terrain within the park offers challenges for all ability levels. The trails range from double track, fire roads and old paved roads to technical singletrack. The common themes shared by most trails at Lincoln Woods are technical descents and lung busting climbs. The climbs may not be long when compared to truly mountainous terrain, but what they lack in distance they make up for with technical difficulty and grade. The same rocky features that make the area a haven for rock climbers also serve to make technically challenging trails for mtb riding. If you enjoy rock face riding, steep rollers, natural drops and hard climbs then Lincoln Woods should be on your list of places to check out.

The trails at Lincoln Woods offer an awesome opportunity for riders to hone their technical riding skills while strengthening their aerobic capacity on the climbs. For this reason many local XC racers utilize the park to get in shape for MTB racing while also working on their bike handling abilities. Freeriders also enjoy the park immensely, although maybe not as much for the abundant climbing opportunities. The natural rock outcroppings and slick rock trails offer outstanding opportunities for highly technical riding. Due to the mostly up/down nature of the trails there are plenty of descents loaded with natural challenges to keep skilled riders happy for hours. There is flatter terrain, and some easier trails, located on the western edge of the park. These trails run parallel to the road and eventually emerge near the fishing pavilion on Olney Pond.

Most of the trails at Lincoln Woods are not on a map, and the network of roads, ridges and hills can be confusing to a newcomer. In general the trails are ridden in a clockwise manner from the parking lots found near the 146 entrance. Most XC rides start from Quinsnicket road and head east into the woods, and then up and to the north eventually looping back toward the parking area via the trails on Sunset Point.

All of the riding in the north section of the park is done east of Quinsnicket road, this is in Zone B (see link to the map below). This is due to DEM and State Park policy that has granted only equestrians access to the trails located west of the road behind the horse stables (Zone A). Please respect the signage and the policies of the park staff when riding in Lincoln Woods. Like any smaller park located near a major city Lincoln Woods tends to become quite crowded on a weekend. Early morning rides are encouraged during the summer months, and weekdays are a better time to ride. There is no hunting allowed in Lincoln Woods so there is no need to wear blaze orange, unless that’s your thing. In which case by all means feel free to rock the neon.
