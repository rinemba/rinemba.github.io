---

RI NEMBA minutes from 9/2/14 meeting held at Doherty's, Warwick. 7:00 PM start, 17 in attendance. 

### Riding Area Reports
- Big River dry, dusty, sandy, loose but otherwise great
- Arcadia excellent condition
- Lincoln Woods same but a couple of trees down. 
- Burlingame - RI Nemba and AMC teaming up to do some trail work on Saturday 9/6/14 from 8:30 AM to 1:00 PM, overnight camping will be available at no charge, all volunteers welcome. 

### Take a Kid Mountain Biking
Member Chis Nichols will host a Take a Kid Mountain Biking event at Diamond Hill on Saturday 10/04/14. Our group was also asked to host a similar event the same day at the Providence Cyclocross event in Roger Williams Park. Someone suggested that instead of competing with Chris's event that we have TAKMB on Sunday 10/05/14. 

### Arcadia Fun Ride 
Sunday 9/14/14 - all permits obtained, food truck (Paco's Tacos) and port-a-potty in place, anyone who would like to help with this event should contact chapter President John Sumner. 

### Big River Dumping
It has been observed by membership that a lot trash is being dumped in Big River, including at the old Read house site off Division Road. There is no gate at this entrance, perhaps the chapter would be willing to donate the cost of a gate so that DEM could have one installed there. Peter G to contact DEM to discuss. 

### Holiday Party
Plans for Christmas/holiday party - President John suggested having it at Doherty's, suggested date is Friday 12/12/14, more details to follow. 

### RI NEMBA IT Dept. 
Contacted NEMBA corporate about using the nemba.org site, suggested that for now we plan on upgrading our existing word press site. IT suggested that we post chapter news items on our website. 

### Special guest Bill Boles
Passed out some business cards that were made for Cape Cod Nemba for us to review. The card has a QR code on it that can be read by a smart phone that would take the phone user to the nemba.org website. Bill asked that going forward we check with our neighboring chapters when planning a fun ride or similar event so as to avoid scheduling conflicts. Bill is looking into setting up a possible Fat Bike winter ride series; perhaps RI could team up with nearby chapters to co-sponsor these events. 

### Promotion
Vermont Mtb Bike Assn gives out lanyards that members put on their bikes to help make their group known to non-members, maybe NEMBA could do the same. 

### Facebook Spam
We are asking all of our Facebook site administrators to carefully review requests received from non-members to join the FB group. 

Next meeting will be held at Doherty's on Tuesday 10/7/14 at 7:00 PM. 

*Meeting adjourned at 8:40 PM.*
