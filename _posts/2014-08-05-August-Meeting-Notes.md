##Riding area reports
- Big River, Arcadia, Lincoln Woods all in great shape, summertime dry conditions, a bit dusty on the trails.

NEMBA is looking for volunteers to help with a trail building project – Carrabassett (Maine) Trailfest, Aug. 22-24. Food and camping will be provided, there will be rides each day after trail work has been completed. Arcadia fun ride is scheduled for Sunday, September 14th. We need volunteers to help with arrowing, registration table. President Sumner is hoping to hold a trail prep day in Arcadia prior to the fun ride, details TBD.

Mark Patinkin of the Providence Journal may be interested in meeting or riding with us in the near future to write about NEMBA and mountain biking in RI.

Our IT team advised that the Facebook member forum and event pages are up and running smoothly. They are ready to set up a new website that would be tied in to nemba.org, just waiting for NEMBA corporate to allow the team to begin construction.

A 0.7 mi. section of new trail has been flagged in Burlingame, just north of Wachaug Pond. This would be a by-pass of water bars on the Yellow Dot trail. All approvals have been given by DEM. A trail-building date is TBD.

The Diamond Hill pump track has been completed. RI NEMBA supplied funding for this project, we look forward to seeing this new resource being utilized soon.

The Lincoln Woods fun ride is scheduled for Sunday November 2, with a weather date of November 9. There was some discussion about a possible Fat Bike event sometime this winter at George Washington and/or Pulaski Park in northern RI.

The meeting was adjourned at 8:20 PM.
