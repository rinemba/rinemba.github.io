# Visiting Riders
Welcome to our humble state, little Rhodie, the size of a county in many other states! Maybe you’re renting a cottage for a week near the beach or traveling through RI for a business meeting. Welcome!

Don’t be fooled by our size, despite this fact we have some really nice trail networks here. Arcadia, Big River, Burlingame, Lincoln Woods & Prudence Island all offer good varied riding. Epic rides can had at the first two, of easily 30 miles if you are so moved so you can be assured of a good sleep after a local meal of clear chowda and clam bombs and maybe a cabinet. While Burlingame and Lincoln Woods are smaller, they have great trails some of which will challenge expert riders. Prudence Island is a different kind of destination all together with ferry only access.



You can find basic maps of these locations here on the web site. Bring a compass (or a gps) and an open mind and you’ll have a good time. A personal suggestion to deal with unfamiliar trails is to mark each intersection with a stick arrow to show the direction you’re headed. That way, at least, in a pinch you can retrace your path back to your car.



Take note of the schedule of weekday rides in the calendar section of the web site. Feel free to contact the ride leaders and join one of these rides. We love show off our trails and often have visiting riders.

And if you have a minute after your romps in the RI woods, drop me an email and tell us about your experiences (gengler.peter@gmail.com)

PS: As a side story (and the reason I added this section to our web site) was an enlightening trip I recently did to an un-named location in upstate NY which bills itself as a mtbking paradise.

Web downloadable brochures showed numerous trail networks of all kinds. As soon as I arrived I checked into the local bike shop only to find one of the primary riding sites was in the middle of a multi year logging project (no news about that on the web!). Not to be set back, the shop owner sent me off on some other trails and the first day I got a nice ride of 30 miles of varied riding. The second day started on a trail that four separate people told me to ride. The first mile was fine, then soon after it became progressively more impassible. Blow downs increased in frequency to gave me a 1000′ ride before I had to drag my bike through another full tree. Eventually it got so bad I was just walking. Clearly none of the people who recommended riding this trail had been on in for years (and why it was even on the map is another point). Eventually it got so bad I actually lost it 3 miles in (I kept thinking it had to get better, and couldn’t get worse). ~ What became clear to me was that despite this town’s incredible location and their intent to promote the area as a mtbk mecca there just weren’t that many year round riders in this little town to work the trails and keep track of the conditions.

Anyway, the point is, here, in little Rhodie we’ve got a pretty sizable riding community to ride and maintain our trail network so if its on the map, it should be ridable!
