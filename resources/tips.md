# Tips for Group Rides


Chris, who is one of the Thursday Bat Patrol Riders, wrote this in 08 to introduce new riders to how we TRY to run the Group Rides.

Some Tips for Newbie Riders on the NEMBA group rides

1) Pick your group! There are often 3 groups that break off on a ride. Relaxed, Normal, and Go Fast. Try the relaxed first and work yourself up in speed. Relaxed is a nice workout and not completely slow. Relaxed rides will sometimes stop and let riders ‘retry’ a section for practice. Normal is a more sustained pace with little stopping. Go Fast is like the group that wants to look like they got a tan but its wind burn!

2) You will NOT be left behind. Often there will be a ‘sweeper’ in the back of the group. He/She is there to make sure everyone makes it thru the ride safely. This person may be changed throughout the ride. Also they may actually pass you! This normally happens when a fun downhill section is coming up and they just want a quick bit of fun. They will wait for you near the bottom!

3) Just because you don’t see anyone ahead of you, doesn’t mean you will get lost. Rides will often stop at an intersection to make sure all riders know which direction to go. If you come upon an intersection and see no one, scream “Which way?!”. They will hear you and let you know. This usually never happens because of tip #4!

4) “LEFT!”, “RIGHT!”, “BRANCH!”. You will here these being screamed often. This is to let the riders behind you know which direction the group is turning. It gets shouted down the line of riders. Do your part for the people behind you, and shout it out. Even if you are the last one down the line, shout it out! Calling “BRANCH!” lets the rider behind you know that a branch has bent back on you and when you ride through, its going to snap back and hit anyone behind you! You may also hear “STOPPING!”, which usually means I fell down and the group is stopping quick before they run me over : )

5) WAIT. If somehow you do get seperated from the group and come to an intersection and you are not sure which way to go. WAIT. This an happen when someone has a michanical and the gap between riders opens up a lot. Very likely someone up front will realize you (and maybe those behind you) have been dropped. The ride leader should send someone back down the trail to find you. If you don’t wait and take a wrong turn, the likelyhood of finding you becomes not so good.

6) Space yourself out. Being too close to the rider in front of you is asking for trouble. You can’t see a proper line to ride. You won’t have time to react if something happens either. If your riding behind me watch out! I’m bound to crash some anytime :)

7) If you want to pass someone in front of you call it “coming up on your left” or something like that goes a long way on safely riding as a group.

8) Test yourself, but be prepared to get off the trail ASAP! New riders are encouraged to try new things. Test themselves on tough technical sections. However they MUST keep in mind the riders behind them. For instance I am HORRIBLE on uphill sections, but trying to get better. I often get caught halfway up the hill on a root and lose all momentum. It is my responsibility to get myself and my bike to the side of the trail as fast as possible to allow the other riders to attempt the section.

Also, if you’re not falling you’re learning is a good rule of thumb.

9) NEVER stop on the trail directly after a technical section. Be it a plank, log, rock garden, top of a hill, downhill, etc. Give the riders behind you enough space to ride through the section and continue on. Stopping after riding a plank across a stream, means the rider behind you may now be stuck stopping on the plank and risks falling off.

10 Don’t be ashamed to let faster riders pass, or to safely pass a slower rider. Remember you will never be left behind. So it doesn’t matter what position you are in. I ride with a buddy who beats me on uphills while I beat him on downhills. We often let each other pass so we can enjoy our strengths. Why does there always seem to be more uphills then downhills? :)

11) Don’t be afraid to ask questions!! After a ride, or during a quick break asking questions may help you out more then you know. All of the riders I’ve encountered are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. (Well… I can’t tell with the go fast guys. They don’t stand still long enough to hear an answer! Wooosh!)

12) We want you there! We want you to have fun! Don’t worry if you are slow at first and carrying your bike over every log. If they kicked people out for that, I’d have been gone a long time ago! ; )

I hope these 10 tips help out some of our new riders. I look forward to riding with all of you in the Relaxed or Normal groups. (Seriously.. the Go Fast group isn’t human! * )

“How the hell did we ride uphill all day, yet end in the same elevation we started?!”

++++++++++++++++

I would add a few more ….

13) I feel all riders should travel as if they are self sufficient even though we ride as a group. That means at a minimum carry a small tool kit, spare tube, tire irons, a patch kit and pump (and perhaps a “snap link” to fix a broken chain). Also, I believe strongly that everyone should have some form of emergency light. Even though you may not be planning a night ride, a few mechanicals (let alone a medical) can eat up that window before dark. With the cost of LED flashlights at Benny’s about $10. there is no excuse for not having a light. Wrap a foot of tape around the shaft of your pump for taping the light to your helmet or bars. And of course some basic medical supplies are always a good idea.

Some of us go to the kitchen sink level; spare derailleur hanger, shifter and brake cable, crank bolt or two, cleat bolts, some zip ties, piece of nylon webbing (to put inside a torn tire side wall). These things that might add a half pound to your pack can be priceless for the difference between a ride and a long walk out. Remember, we are ultimately out there in the woods for exercise so its just weight.

14) Feed the motor. It may seem like a few hours in the woods on the bike’s no big deal (if you compare it to a spin on the bike path) but you burn a huge amount of calories. Its great to have a proteen bar or two.
